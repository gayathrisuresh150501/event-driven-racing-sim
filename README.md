# Event-Driven Racing Simulation

A deterministic, event-sourced simulation engine with autonomous agents and
a terminal-based renderer.

## Goals
- Deterministic state transitions
- Event-driven architecture
- Replayable simulations
- Distributed-system ready design

The racing domain is used as a vehicle for exploring systems design concepts.
